Made this project so that I can understand pytorch lightning better.

PyTorch Lightning ->
yTorch Lightning is a lightweight PyTorch wrapper that provides a high-level interface for organizing and standardizing PyTorch code. It simplifies the training of deep learning models by providing boilerplate code for common tasks such as distributed training, mixed-precision training, and logging, while also improving the readability and reproducibility of the code.

PyTorch Lightning separates the training loop from the model code, allowing for easier experimentation and testing of different architectures and training configurations. It also provides a set of pre-built modules for common deep learning tasks such as classification, segmentation, and generative modeling.

In summary, PyTorch Lightning is a framework that streamlines the development and deployment of PyTorch-based machine learning models by providing a set of abstractions and best practices. It allows researchers and developers to focus on the core aspects of their research without having to worry about the implementation details.
